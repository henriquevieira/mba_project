No insecticide is applied to the cotton plants at least unit after seed set has occurred. Pollination of the cotton plants is accomplished during mid- to late-summer through pollen transfer by the ground-dwelling bees and cottonseeds are formed.

",detection apparatus and method of use,"an apparatus for the detection and recording of the presence of a filament or other small object at a station (13) is described. the apparatus includes light beam detection means (70, 71) and means (14) for rotating the object at the station so that the object interrupts the light beam as it is rotated and is detected and recorded by a counting means (102, 108, 110). the apparatus is particularly useful for the detection of filaments and other small objects which cannot be positioned precisely at the station. the apparatus is specifically useful for detecting roots or shoots (201) resulting from seed (200) germination in a tube (11).","detection apparatus and method of use an apparatus for the detection and recording of the presence of a filament or other small object at a station (13) is described. the apparatus includes light beam detection means (70, 71) and means (14) for rotating the object at the station so that the object interrupts the light beam as it is rotated and is detected and recorded by a counting means (102, 108, 110). the apparatus is particularly useful for the detection of filaments and other small objects which cannot be positioned precisely at the station. the apparatus is specifically useful for detecting roots or shoots (201) resulting from seed (200) germination in a tube (11).",
