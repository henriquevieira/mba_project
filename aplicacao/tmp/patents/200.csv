Solar irradiance is primarily determined by a location's spatial relationship with the Sun and the atmospheric conditions that impact the transmission of the radiation. The spatial relationship between the Sun and a location on Earth is determined by established astronomical formulas. The impact of atmospheric conditions may be estimated via proxy using pixels from satellite imagery. While satellite-based irradiance estimation has proven effective, availability of the input data can be limited and the resolution is often incapable of capturing local weather phenomena. Brief qualitative descriptions of general atmospheric conditions are widely available from internet weather services at higher granularity than satellite imagery.

","
            A process and device for managing irrigation of plants or crops using crop canopy temperate measurements by use of a specific time threshold. In this process, the canopy temperature of the target plant is repeatedly measured with an infrared thermometer. After each measurement, the canopy temperature is compared with a predetermined threshold canopy temperature, above which temperature the plant is thermally stressed. If the measured canopy temperature is less than or equal to the threshold canopy temperature, or if the existing humidity is restrictive to plant cooling, then irrigation is not indicated and the canopy temperature measurement is repeated at its designated time. However, if both the measured canopy temperature is greater than the threshold temperature, and the humidity is not restrictive to plant cooling, then an increment of time is added to a time register. The accumulated time in the time register is then compared to the time threshold, a predetermined constant defined as about the mean of the length of time per day that the canopy temperature for the plant, in a well-watered and non-stressed condition, exceeded the threshold canopy temperature in the target geographical area. As long as the accumulated time is substantially less than the time threshold, irrigation is either unnecessary or ineffective to achieve transpirational cooling, and the process is again repeated with measurement of the canopy temperature. However, once the accumulated time exceeds or is approximately equal to the time threshold, transpirational cooling is indicated and an irrigation signal is generated.        "

","
            A method of using magnetic influence on flow streams of liquids and gases to over excite their atoms, break existing molecular bonds, and from two oppositely charged flow streams cause immediate and permanent bonding of oppositely charged ions to create a new molecular composition. While magnetic influence is predominately responsible for the molecular reorganization produced, induced turbulence disrupts a tendency for laminar flow in the flow streams, creating more chaotic movement and molecule collisions in liquids/gases used and a more complete result. Mixing of the two oppositely charged flow streams is preferred via a venturi. Magnetic influence on flow streams can be applied more than once. Using this method with water having a molecular composition of H2O in a primary flow stream and ozone gas in a secondary flow stream, and mixing of the oppositely charged flow streams using a venturi, a new molecular composition of H2O5 can be created.

If the measured plant temperature is greater than the setpoint temperature, and humidity is not restrictive to plant cooling, then irrigation can be triggered to retain the plant within the desired stressed level, as determined by the temperature of the plant. By this method, irrigation can be withheld to increase plant temperature or applied to reduce plant temperature.

                    Soybean vegetable oil having elevated concentrations of both palmitic acid and stearic acid                
","
            A soybean vegetable oil obtained by crushing and extraction from mature soybean seeds is provided in which the endogenously formed concentrations of both palmitic acid (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0) are simultaneously elevated. Neither elevated saturated fatty acid concentration is negated by the expression of the other saturated fatty acid in the elevated concentration. The endogenously formed palmitic acid content is from about 14% to about 24% and the endogenously formed stearic acid content is from about 20% to about 30% by weight of the total fatty acid composition. In a preferred embodiment, the endogenously formed linolenic acid (C18:3) component of the soybean oil is no more than about 3% by weight of the total fatty acid composition.        "

                    Method for producing hybrid plants using fertility selective growth media                
","
            A method of producing hybrid plants involves inducing cross-pollination of self-pollinating species by selecting a female plant and a male plant having different genotypes, the female plant having a phenotype of sensitivity to a micronutrient deficiency, and the male plant having a phenotype of male fertility, growing the female plant to sexual maturity in a fertility-selective growth medium deficient for the micronutrient, to produce a plant having female fertility and male sterility, growing the male plant to sexual maturity to produce a plant having high male fertility, cross-pollinating the female plant with pollen from the male plant to produce cross-fertilization with essentially no self-fertilization, raising the female plant to produce hybrid seeds having genetic material from both parents, and harvesting the hybrid seeds. Fertility selective media can be identified by using a set of check genotypes with known responses to a micronutrient deficiency, choosing as the fertility-selective medium those that give desired differences in male sterility between the standard checks. The plants may be wheat and the growth medium may be deficient for boron. The method preferably comprises determining a correlation between boron content of the male reproductive organs by chemical analysis and observation of degrees of male sterility.        "

","
            Fertile transgenic Zea mays (corn) plants which stably express recombinant DNA which is heritable are provided wherein said DNA preferably comprises a recombinant gene which encodes a seed storage protein, so that the amino acid profile of the corn is improved.        "

                    Inducing hyperaccumulation of metals in plant shoots                
","
            The present invention provides methods by which hyperaccumulation of metals in plant shoots is induced by exposure to inducing agents. Hyperaccumulation occurs as part of a two-step process in which metals are first accumulated into plant roots; subsequent transport to plant shoots is induced by exposure to the agent. In preferred embodiments, manipulations that increase availability of metals to the plant are employed prior to application of the inducing agent. Effective inducing agents include conditions of low pH, chelators, herbicides, and high levels of heavy metals. Other phytotoxic agents are also useful. Application of multiple inducing agents results in synergistic effects.        "

","
            According to the invention, there is provided an inbred corn plant designated 01DHD10. This invention thus relates to the plants, seeds and tissue cultures of the inbred corn plant 01DHD10, and to methods for producing a corn plant produced by crossing the inbred plant 01DHD10 with itself or with another corn plant, such as another inbred. This invention further relates to corn seeds and plants produced by crossing the inbred plant 01DHD10 with another corn plant, such as another inbred, and to crosses with related species. This invention further relates to the inbred and hybrid genetic complements of the inbred corn plant 01DHD10, and also to the RFLP and genetic isozyme typing profiles of inbred corn plant 01DHD10.
