While satellite-based irradiance estimation has proven effective, availability of the input data can be limited and the resolution is often incapable of capturing local weather phenomena. Brief qualitative descriptions of general atmospheric conditions are widely available from internet weather services at higher granularity than satellite imagery.

","
            A process and device for managing irrigation of plants or crops using crop canopy temperate measurements by use of a specific time threshold. In this process, the canopy temperature of the target plant is repeatedly measured with an infrared thermometer. After each measurement, the canopy temperature is compared with a predetermined threshold canopy temperature, above which temperature the plant is thermally stressed. If the measured canopy temperature is less than or equal to the threshold canopy temperature, or if the existing humidity is restrictive to plant cooling, then irrigation is not indicated and the canopy temperature measurement is repeated at its designated time. However, if both the measured canopy temperature is greater than the threshold temperature, and the humidity is not restrictive to plant cooling, then an increment of time is added to a time register. The accumulated time in the time register is then compared to the time threshold, a predetermined constant defined as about the mean of the length of time per day that the canopy temperature for the plant, in a well-watered and non-stressed condition, exceeded the threshold canopy temperature in the target geographical area. As long as the accumulated time is substantially less than the time threshold, irrigation is either unnecessary or ineffective to achieve transpirational cooling, and the process is again repeated with measurement of the canopy temperature. However, once the accumulated time exceeds or is approximately equal to the time threshold, transpirational cooling is indicated and an irrigation signal is generated.        "

","
            A method of using magnetic influence on flow streams of liquids and gases to over excite their atoms, break existing molecular bonds, and from two oppositely charged flow streams cause immediate and permanent bonding of oppositely charged ions to create a new molecular composition. While magnetic influence is predominately responsible for the molecular reorganization produced, induced turbulence disrupts a tendency for laminar flow in the flow streams, creating more chaotic movement and molecule collisions in liquids/gases used and a more complete result. Mixing of the two oppositely charged flow streams is preferred via a venturi. Magnetic influence on flow streams can be applied more than once. Using this method with water having a molecular composition of H2O in a primary flow stream and ozone gas in a secondary flow stream, and mixing of the oppositely charged flow streams using a venturi, a new molecular composition of H2O5 can be created.

                    Apparatus and method for sowing second crop in standing crop                
","
            Seeds of a second crop (e.g. soybeans) are sown in a standing grain crop (e.g. wheat). When the grain crop is ripe it is harvested by cutting with a combine at a level slightly above the top of the partially grown second crop. Seeding of the second crop is performed using a self-driven, preferably three-wheel vehicle carrying a grain drill box having flexible tubes which fit between the rows of grain and each of which discharges the seed into a gap between two downward-inward slanted discs which first cut a slit in the ground, then deposit the seed and finally cover the slit. The discs are supported and their depth controlled in such manner as to cause minimum interference with the grain. This invention relates to a new and improved apparatus and method for sowing a second crop in standing grain. More particularly, the invention relates to the use of a seed drill of particular configuration for use in practicing a method whereby two crops may be grown on the same acreage. A typical example of use of the present invention is as follows: At present in the Middle West portion of the United States, winter wheat is sown in the Fall (e.g. October 1) and in the Spring it begins to grow. In accordance with the present invention the seeds of a second crop such as soybeans are planted between the rows of the growing wheat about June 1, for example. At this time the wheat is partially grown and the wheat has choked out any weeds starting to grow in the field. The wheat is harvested when ripe, as for example about July 4, and at this time the beans are only partially grown. The combine used to harvest the wheat is set at a level so that the wheat is cut above the tops of the beans. By this time the beans have grown tall enough and bushy enough to shade any weeds tending to grow in the field. The beans may be harvested when ripe in about October, prior to the time of planting the winter wheat for the next season. A distinguishing feature of the present invention is the seeding of the second crop (hereinafter referred to as soybeans) into the space between the rows of the standing first crop (which may be a grain and is hereinafter referred to as wheat). The apparatus of the present invention uses double discs which slit or cut the soil between the rows of wheat, direct the seeds falling from the seed drill into the slit and then cover the slit. The vehicle on which the seed drill is mounted has small, preferably rubber tired wheels which do a minimum of damage to the wheat. Another feature of the invention is the fact that the wheat may be harvested with minimal damage to the bean plants. It is, accordingly, a principal purpose of the present invention to provide for the efficient growing of two crops on the same soil with a minimum of expense and a minimum of damage to the growing first crop. Another feature of the invention is the fact that the growing wheat protects the bean crop from weeds and hence need not be weeded while the bean plants at the time of the harvesting of the wheat are large enough to shade the adjacent ground against growth of weeds. Elimination of weeds eliminates the need to cultivate and work the ground at the time the beans are planted. Heretofore attempts have been made to seed a second crop in a standing grain crop by dropping the seeds from airplanes or by broadcasting the seed. Such systems have proven unsatisfactory because of uneven distribution of the seed and further that the seeds are not deposited in the ground to a desired depth and hence are dependent upon subsequent rains to start germination. Other features of the invention are the reduction in damage to the wheat during the bean planting and the reduction of damage to the beans during the wheat harvesting. The first crop hereinafter described is specifically wheat but it will be understood that other crops which grow early in the year may be used in performance of the method hereinafter described and particularly rye and flax. Additionally, the invention describes the use of soybeans but it will be understood that other second crops may be substituted.  "
