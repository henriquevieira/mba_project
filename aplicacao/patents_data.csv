            This invention relates generally to the production of maize, commonly known in the United States as corn, and more specifically to hybrid corn plants with certain advantageous phenotypes resulting from interactions of the haploid genetic contributions of inbred parental lines. This invention relates to the hybrid genetic complement, the expression of which produces these phenotypes and to the complement as housed in seeds and tissues, in particular, those capable of producing or regenerating the hybrid plants either in vivo or in vitro. An aspect of this invention, hybrid DK743, is characterized by many advantageous phenotypic traits including superior yield and staygreen. It has characteristic restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and isozyme profiles.
