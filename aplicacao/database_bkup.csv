            Fertilization and irrigation of highly permeable surface soils in semi-arid regions is described wherein the soils are contacted with an aqueous solution of a water soluble plant nutrient salt and an effective amount of a partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide to reduce the permeability of the soil without rendering it impermeable to water flow. It has been found that water soluble plant nutrients and the aforementioned partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide exhibit a synergistic effect to decrease the water permeability of the soils.

","
            A method of producing hybrid plants involves inducing cross-pollination of self-pollinating species by selecting a female plant and a male plant having different genotypes, the female plant having a phenotype of sensitivity to a micronutrient deficiency, and the male plant having a phenotype of male fertility, growing the female plant to sexual maturity in a fertility-selective growth medium deficient for the micronutrient, to produce a plant having female fertility and male sterility, growing the male plant to sexual maturity to produce a plant having high male fertility, cross-pollinating the female plant with pollen from the male plant to produce cross-fertilization with essentially no self-fertilization, raising the female plant to produce hybrid seeds having genetic material from both parents, and harvesting the hybrid seeds. Fertility selective media can be identified by using a set of check genotypes with known responses to a micronutrient deficiency, choosing as the fertility-selective medium those that give desired differences in male sterility between the standard checks. The plants may be wheat and the growth medium may be deficient for boron. The method preferably comprises determining a correlation between boron content of the male reproductive organs by chemical analysis and observation of degrees of male sterility.

            Methods for producing hybrids between domestic and wild soybean that are fertile and can be further bred with other soybean plants are provided, thus allowing transfer of desirable traits and genes from the wild soybean into the domestic soybean. This invention also provides novel media for producing callus and multiple somatic embryos, as well as novel media for producing multiple shoots from the embryos. The hybrid plants are made fertile by colchicine treatment to double their chromosome number so that they can be backcrossed into domestic soybean. These methods and media allow the production of elite soybean lines containing traits or genes from wild soybean as well as a minimum amount of additional wild soybean DNA. Backcrosses containing only one wild soybean chromosome can be produced, as well as sets of such backcrossed lines that each contain one chromosome from the wild ancestor, but collectively all the wild chromosomes from the hybrid ancestor. Plants and plant progeny and plant tissue (tissue including seeds) of plants produced by the foregoing methods are also provided. The methods do not require genetic modification, and thus this invention allows production of domestic soybean plants that are not genetically-modified organisms (non-GMO) but that express desirable traits derived from wild soybean.

                    Apparatus and method for sowing second crop in standing crop                
","
            Seeds of a second crop (e.g. soybeans) are sown in a standing grain crop (e.g. wheat). When the grain crop is ripe it is harvested by cutting with a combine at a level slightly above the top of the partially grown second crop. Seeding of the second crop is performed using a self-driven, preferably three-wheel vehicle carrying a grain drill box having flexible tubes which fit between the rows of grain and each of which discharges the seed into a gap between two downward-inward slanted discs which first cut a slit in the ground, then deposit the seed and finally cover the slit. The discs are supported and their depth controlled in such manner as to cause minimum interference with the grain. This invention relates to a new and improved apparatus and method for sowing a second crop in standing grain. More particularly, the invention relates to the use of a seed drill of particular configuration for use in practicing a method whereby two crops may be grown on the same acreage. A typical example of use of the present invention is as follows: At present in the Middle West portion of the United States, winter wheat is sown in the Fall (e.g. October 1) and in the Spring it begins to grow. In accordance with the present invention the seeds of a second crop such as soybeans are planted between the rows of the growing wheat about June 1, for example. At this time the wheat is partially grown and the wheat has choked out any weeds starting to grow in the field. The wheat is harvested when ripe, as for example about July 4, and at this time the beans are only partially grown. The combine used to harvest the wheat is set at a level so that the wheat is cut above the tops of the beans. By this time the beans have grown tall enough and bushy enough to shade any weeds tending to grow in the field. The beans may be harvested when ripe in about October, prior to the time of planting the winter wheat for the next season. A distinguishing feature of the present invention is the seeding of the second crop (hereinafter referred to as soybeans) into the space between the rows of the standing first crop (which may be a grain and is hereinafter referred to as wheat). The apparatus of the present invention uses double discs which slit or cut the soil between the rows of wheat, direct the seeds falling from the seed drill into the slit and then cover the slit. The vehicle on which the seed drill is mounted has small, preferably rubber tired wheels which do a minimum of damage to the wheat. Another feature of the invention is the fact that the wheat may be harvested with minimal damage to the bean plants. It is, accordingly, a principal purpose of the present invention to provide for the efficient growing of two crops on the same soil with a minimum of expense and a minimum of damage to the growing first crop. Another feature of the invention is the fact that the growing wheat protects the bean crop from weeds and hence need not be weeded while the bean plants at the time of the harvesting of the wheat are large enough to shade the adjacent ground against growth of weeds. Elimination of weeds eliminates the need to cultivate and work the ground at the time the beans are planted. Heretofore attempts have been made to seed a second crop in a standing grain crop by dropping the seeds from airplanes or by broadcasting the seed. Such systems have proven unsatisfactory because of uneven distribution of the seed and further that the seeds are not deposited in the ground to a desired depth and hence are dependent upon subsequent rains to start germination. Other features of the invention are the reduction in damage to the wheat during the bean planting and the reduction of damage to the beans during the wheat harvesting. The first crop hereinafter described is specifically wheat but it will be understood that other crops which grow early in the year may be used in performance of the method hereinafter described and particularly rye and flax.
